Continuous assessment - Rectification of program vulnerabilities 

Write program segments to illustrate the following:

1. A code that allows an attacker to cause stack smashing

2. A code that does not perform range checking
3. A code that allows an attacker to cause variables to overflow and exploit adjacent variables
4. A code that allows an attacker to execute a malicious code by exploiting a pointer variable
5. A code that rectifies the above issues by implementing the following:
* Canary
* Bounds checking
* Tagging
6. A code segment in a web page that allows an attacker to use SQL injection
7. A code segment in a web page that prevents an attacker to use SQL injection
